 my\_n8n\_stack
=================

Welcome to the my\_n8n\_stack repository! This project is designed to showcase how to use the N8N platform for building serverless workflows. The N8N platform allows you to create, deploy and manage workflows that integrate with a wide range of applications and services.

Project Requirements
--------------------

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

* Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)

Dependencies
------------

This project has several dependencies which can be installed using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

The main dependency is the N8N platform itself, which you can find at <https://n8n.io/>. You will also need to have a Node.js environment set up.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my_n8n_stack.git
```
2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Set up a .env file with your N8N API credentials. This can be found in the `.env.example` file.
4. Run the application using the following command:
```sql
npm start
```
How to run the application
-------------------------

Once you have set up your environment, you can run the application by executing the `start` command in the project directory. This will start the N8N server and open the web interface in your default browser.

Relevant Code Examples
---------------------

Here is an example of a simple workflow that uses the N8N platform to send an email:
```python
{
  "type": "node",
  "name": "Send Email",
  "topic": "email_sending",
  "description": "Sends an email using the N8N platform.",
  "properties": {
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "body": "This is a test email from the my_n8n_stack project."
  }
}
```
Conclusion
